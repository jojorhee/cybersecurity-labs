# Cybersecurity Labs


This Github repo contains notes and documentation for labs, guided exercises, and challenges for learning cybersecurity. These labs are mainly from my home lab, and I intend on doing some from other websites like Over the Wire, HTB, and THM. Right now my focus is to learn about a range of cybersecurity fields, including penetration testing (top interest), SOC analysts, cybersecurity engineers, cloud security, and more. This experience has deepened my understanding of the core fundamentals of cybersecurity.
